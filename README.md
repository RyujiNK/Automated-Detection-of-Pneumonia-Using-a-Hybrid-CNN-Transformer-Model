# Automated Pneumonia Detection with ConViT

This repository contains code for a deep learning project aimed at automated detection of pneumonia using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (ConViT) model. This hybrid architecture leverages both CNNs for local feature extraction and transformers for global context modeling to improve accuracy and interpretability of pneumonia diagnoses from chest X-ray images.

### Project Overview
Pneumonia is a major health challenge worldwide. This project addresses the need for automated, accurate, and interpretable diagnostic tools to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. The hybrid ConViT model developed in this project combines the strengths of CNNs and transformers, achieving enhanced diagnostic performance by capturing both local and global image features.

### Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to improve pneumonia detection accuracy while also providing interpretable diagnostic outputs. Traditional CNNs often focus on local image patterns, which may miss larger contextual patterns. By combining transformers with CNNs, we aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and model transparency, potentially assisting radiologists in making faster, more reliable decisions.

### Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** PneumoniaMNIST from the MedMNIST repository
- **Description:** The dataset contains labeled chest X-ray images of healthy and pneumonia-positive cases.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Images are resized to 128x128 pixels.
  - Pixel values are normalized.
  - Data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotations, and cropping are applied to enhance model robustness.

For more details on the dataset, please refer to the [MedMNIST repository](https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST).

### Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:
1. **CNN Backbone:** Extracts low-level features from input images using convolutional layers.
2. **Transformer Encoder:** Processes the CNN-extracted features to capture global relationships and context within the image.
3. **Fully Connected Layer:** Aggregates the transformer’s output to classify the image as showing either pneumonia or healthy lungs.

The architecture leverages **attention maps** generated by transformers to provide visual interpretability, highlighting the areas of the X-ray that most influenced the model’s decision.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository_name.git
   cd repository_name
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**
   Download PneumoniaMNIST from the MedMNIST repository and place it in the designated `data/` folder.

### Usage

1. **Train the Model:**
   To train the ConViT model on PneumoniaMNIST data, run:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```
   Here, `config.yaml` specifies the hyperparameters and settings for training.

2. **Evaluate the Model:**
   After training, evaluate the model performance on the test set by running:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path models/convit_final.pth
   ```

3. **Visualize Attention Maps:**
   To generate attention maps for model interpretability, use:
   ```bash
   python visualize_attention.py --model_path models/convit_final.pth
   ```
   This outputs images showing the parts of the X-ray the model focused on during its classification decision.

### Results
The ConViT model achieves strong classification performance on the PneumoniaMNIST dataset, with the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** 95%
- **F1 Score:** 0.94
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.97

Attention maps highlight the regions of the lung X-rays that were most influential in the model’s decision, helping to make the model's predictions interpretable to medical professionals.
